## Pr√©sentation

[Dungeon Thief](https://gamejolt.com/games/dungeonthief/656613) is a third person 3D infiltration game, where your goal is to retrieve pots from a dungeon, which have been stolen by the monsters of the dungeons.
The game is developed under Unreal Engine 4 with the C ++ language


**Dungeon Thief is a single player infiltration game with the aim of recovering the sacred pots, made in the dungeons.**  
Your role is therefore to infiltrate the various dungeons, and to steal, one by one, the various pots brought back by the watches, in order to bring them back to your village. Because some of these pots, in addition to nourishing beings, are also a source of unfailing mystical energy, allowing the village mages to work, and save the country from the plague of monsters.
